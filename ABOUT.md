## About Me
I've been in tech and loved it since I was a child. I recall my father getting a Commodore 64
our the house when I was around 4. I enjoyed playing games on it while he dabbled in basic. 
From there, he started building 8086 machines as I got older and we frequently visited 
computer trade shows on the weekend to upgrade and enhance our home computers. I've always
had a fascination with computers with building them, gaming and exploring computer graphics.
This fascination led me to pursure a hopefilled 3d animation and visual effects dream. The
first opportunity I had to getting into 3d was with POV-Ray on DOS. Little did I know I was
writting C++ at the time, but this didn't stop me from experimenting and attempting to build
3d models and even animate within the program. I took a BASIC class in middle school and
then C++ in High School, as there wasn't much support in my school for computer science at
the time. I struggled with a lot of the concepts, but that didn't keep me from continuing
my journey. Along the way, I was taking art classes, as I was still very passionate about
pursuing a 3d animation dream. Much of this dream was inspired by watching plenty of cartoons
and the introduction of CG in the movie industry. I loved watching the TV series 
[Movie Magic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108865/) in my teenage years which solidified my 
passion further for the movie industry and 3d animation.
