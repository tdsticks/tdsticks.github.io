## Personal Traits
- Subject Matter Expertise (SME): I frequently find myself in situations where either no one is willing to take on challenging tasks or no one within my sphere has the necessary skills for such tasks.

- Grit: It is a positive non-cognitive trait that is based on an individual's perseverance and passion for a particular long-term goal or end state. It involves having the courage and determination to overcome difficulties and entails a steadfast commitment to achieving one's objectives.

# History
### Early Years
Ever since I was a child, I have been passionate about technology. I have vivid memories of my father bringing home a Commodore 64 when I was around 4 years old. While he tinkered with basic programming, I enjoyed playing games on it. As I grew older, my father started building 8086 machines, and we often attended computer trade shows on the weekends to upgrade and enhance our home computers. I have always been fascinated with computers, including building them, gaming, and exploring computer graphics. This fascination led me to pursue my hopeful dream of 3D animation and visual effects. My first opportunity to work with 3D was with POV-Ray on DOS, where I unwittingly began writing C++. Nonetheless, I experimented with building 3D models and even animating within the program. Though there was little support for computer science in my school, I took a BASIC class in middle school and C++ in high school. While I struggled with many of the concepts, I continued to pursue my passion. Along the way, I also took art classes, as I was still keen on pursuing my 3D animation dream. Watching cartoons and the introduction of CG in the movie industry inspired much of my dream. The TV series, [Movie Magic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108865/) solidified my passion even further for the movie industry and 3D animation. All of this ultimately led me to attend a trade school in NC for 3D animation, and upon graduation, I returned home to MI in search of opportunities.


### My Software Development Journey
##### SV3 Media (start-up)
My first office job served as a valuable stepping stone into my 3D and software development career. I was initially hired to create Flash animations and perform basic web-related tasks. However, within six months of starting, the company won a major project with GM to develop an environmentally-friendly website for children. I was responsible for building, animating, and implementing 3D characters into the Flash site. I had the privilege of working alongside some incredibly talented people, including B.K. Taylor, an outstanding artist who was also one of the creators of the pilot episode of Tool Time with Tim Allen (which is where they got the name Tim "Taylor" from). While B.K. worked on the character art, I modeled and animated the characters under his direction, added voiceovers, and then converted the animations to vector for Flash. Despite the significant challenges involved in using Flash at the time, the experience proved to be invaluable since it allowed me to develop my coding skills using Actionscript.

##### Freelancing
After experiencing limited growth opportunities at the company, I made the decision to resign and venture into freelancing in web design. I also teamed up with a friend to launch a web business. This period proved to be a valuable learning experience for me during the early stages of my career. Although I was able to secure a few regular clients and make some profit, it was challenging to establish my business as a sustainable venture. After roughly a year and a half, a friend from The SEMAFX Network reached out to me about a CG position at Armstrong-White. I was thrilled about the opportunity and accepted the position.

##### Armstrong-White
Receiving the phone call offering me a position at an actual studio/small agency was a dream come true, especially because they were looking for 3D artists to contribute to the digital garage that everyone in the industry was pursuing. It was a groundbreaking movement in the automotive industry to take engineering CAD data and repurpose it for marketing purposes. During my time at AW, I had the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional individuals, leverage advanced technologies and platforms, and work long hours, often ranging from 60 to 80 hours a week. Although I started out as an artist cleaning, manipulating, and rendering 3D automotive models, I gradually shifted to a more technical role, where I began writing scripts for the 3D artists. Moreover, I became increasingly fascinated with the render farm and explored ways to make it more efficient. However, things took a turn for the worse for the industry, and many employees, including myself, were eventually laid off. I considered returning to self-employment and did work on a contract job while searching for my next opportunity, but my period of unemployment was brief.

##### BNP Media
A close friend and mentor approached me with an exciting job prospect as a web developer for BNP Media, a leading publishing company. Although it was a transition from my previous 3d work, the opportunity allowed me to expand my coding and development skills within a corporate environment. At BNP Media, I primarily used Flash Actionscript and Javascript to create a dynamic digital magazine platform for over 40 of the company's publications. Additionally, I gained invaluable experience collaborating with editors and publishers, as my department was the central hub for support and development of each publication, which each operated as a separate business entity.
