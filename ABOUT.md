# History
### Early Years
I've been passionate about technology since I was a child. I recall my father getting a Commodore 64
for our the house when I was around 4. I enjoyed playing games on it while he dabbled in basic. 
From there, he started building 8086 machines as I got older and we frequently visited 
computer trade shows on the weekend to upgrade and enhance our home computers. I've always
had a fascination with computers with building them, gaming and exploring computer graphics.
This fascination led me to pursure a hopefilled 3d animation and visual effects dream. The
first opportunity I had to getting into 3d was with POV-Ray on DOS. Little did I know I was
writting C++ at the time, but this didn't stop me from experimenting and attempting to build
3d models and even animate within the program. I took a BASIC class in middle school and
then C++ in High School, as there wasn't much support in my school for computer science at
the time. I struggled with a lot of the concepts, but that didn't keep me from continuing
my journey. Along the way, I was taking art classes, as I was still very passionate about
pursuing a 3d animation dream. Much of this dream was inspired by watching plenty of cartoons
and the introduction of CG in the movie industry. I loved watching the TV series 
[Movie Magic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108865/) in my teenage years which solidified my 
passion further for the movie industry and 3d animation. This all led me to go to college for 
3d animation, which I ended up going to a trade school in NC for. Afterwards, I came back home
to MI and started looking for opportunities.

### My Software Development Journey
##### SV3 Media (start-up)
My first office job became a nice stepping stone into my 3d and software development career. I was hired
to learn and create Flash animations, along with some basic web work. Not 6 months into working
there, the company was awarded a big project with GM to build a kids environmental-friendly website.
I was tasked with building, animating and implmenting 3d characters into the Flash site. I worked 
along side with some great people, one of which was B.K. Taylor, a great artist and one of the creators
of the pilot of Tool Time with Tim Allen (that's where they got Tim "Taylor" from). So B.K. was creating
the character art and I was modeling, animating them (under his direction) with voiceovers, then converting
the animations to vector for Flash. Using Flash at the time was a really challenging, but good experience, 
since I could also code a bit for the website using Actionscript.

##### Freelancing
After not seeing much growth at the company, I decided to quit and pursue freelancing in web design along
with attempting to start a web business with a friend of mine. I learned alot during this time early in my
career. I had a few regular clients and was semi-profitable, but it was also a struggle to grow my business
into something worth keeping. So after about a year and a half, a friend from the The SEMAFX Network contacted
me about a CG position at Armstrong-White and I happily took the position.

##### Armstrong-White

Getting that phone call to work at an actual studio / small agency was a dream come true. On top of that, they were looking for 3D artists to help with the digital garage everyone in the industry was chasing after. Taking engineering CAD data and making it usable for marketing purposes was a ground breaking movement within the automotive industry. During this time at AW, I was exposed to a lot of great people, technologies and platforms while working 60-80 hour weeks. Although, I started off as an artist cleaning, manipulating and rendering 3d automotive vehicles, I took a turn for more of a technical role in writing scripts for the 3d artists. Also, I become very intrigued with the renderfarm and how I could make it run more efficiently. Eventually, things took a turn with the industry and many eventually became laid off, including myself. I was tempted to go back to being self-employed and did have one contract job while seeking my next opportunity, but my unemployment didn't last very long.
