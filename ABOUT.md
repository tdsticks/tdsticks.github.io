# History
### Early Years
Ever since I was a child, I have been passionate about technology. I have vivid memories of my father bringing home a Commodore 64 when I was around 4 years old. While he tinkered with basic programming, I enjoyed playing games on it. As I grew older, my father started building 8086 machines, and we often attended computer trade shows on the weekends to upgrade and enhance our home computers. I have always been fascinated with computers, including building them, gaming, and exploring computer graphics. This fascination led me to pursue my hopeful dream of 3D animation and visual effects. My first opportunity to work with 3D was with POV-Ray on DOS, where I unwittingly began writing C++. Nonetheless, I experimented with building 3D models and even animating within the program. Though there was little support for computer science in my school, I took a BASIC class in middle school and C++ in high school. While I struggled with many of the concepts, I continued to pursue my passion. Along the way, I also took art classes, as I was still keen on pursuing my 3D animation dream. Watching cartoons and the introduction of CG in the movie industry inspired much of my dream. The TV series, [Movie Magic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108865/) solidified my passion even further for the movie industry and 3D animation. All of this ultimately led me to attend a trade school in NC for 3D animation, and upon graduation, I returned home to MI in search of opportunities.


### My Software Development Journey
##### SV3 Media (start-up)
My first office job served as a valuable stepping stone into my 3D and software development career. I was initially hired to create Flash animations and perform basic web-related tasks. However, within six months of starting, the company won a major project with GM to develop an environmentally-friendly website for children. I was responsible for building, animating, and implementing 3D characters into the Flash site. I had the privilege of working alongside some incredibly talented people, including [B.K. Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._K._Taylor), an outstanding artist who was also one of the creators of the pilot episode of Tool Time with Tim Allen (which is where they got the name Tim "Taylor" from). While B.K. worked on the character art, I modeled and animated the characters under his direction, added voiceovers, and then converted the animations to vector for Flash. Despite the significant challenges involved in using Flash at the time, the experience proved to be invaluable since it allowed me to develop my coding skills using Actionscript.


##### Freelancing
After experiencing limited growth opportunities at the company, I made the decision to resign and venture into freelancing in web design. I also teamed up with a friend to launch a web business. This period proved to be a valuable learning experience for me during the early stages of my career. Although I was able to secure a few regular clients and make some profit, it was challenging to establish my business as a sustainable venture. After roughly a year and a half, a friend from The SEMAFX Network reached out to me about a CG position at Armstrong-White. I was thrilled about the opportunity and accepted the position.


##### Armstrong-White
Receiving the phone call offering me a position at an actual studio/small agency was a dream come true, especially because they were looking for 3D artists to contribute to the digital garage that everyone in the industry was pursuing. It was a groundbreaking movement in the automotive industry to take engineering CAD data and repurpose it for marketing purposes. During my time at AW, I had the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional individuals, leverage advanced technologies and platforms, and work long hours, often ranging from 60 to 80 hours a week. Although I started out as an artist cleaning, manipulating, and rendering 3D automotive models, I gradually shifted to a more technical role, where I began writing scripts for the 3D artists. Moreover, I became increasingly fascinated with the render farm and explored ways to make it more efficient. However, things took a turn for the worse for the industry, and many employees, including myself, were eventually laid off. I considered returning to self-employment and did work on a contract job while searching for my next opportunity, but my period of unemployment was brief.


##### BNP Media
A close friend and mentor approached me with an exciting job prospect as a web developer for BNP Media, a leading publishing company. Although it was a transition from my previous 3d work, the opportunity allowed me to expand my coding and development skills within a corporate environment. At BNP Media, I primarily used Flash Actionscript and Javascript to create a dynamic digital magazine platform for over 40 of the company's publications. Additionally, I gained invaluable experience collaborating with editors and publishers, as my department was the central hub for support and development of each publication, which each operated as a separate business entity.


##### With A Twist Stuido (start-up)
While I was feeling like I had hit a plateau at BNP Media, a colleague from Armstrong-White approached me about a new VFX business they had just launched. They were in need of a technical developer due to their growth and I didn't hesitate to take the position. During my time at With A Twist Studio, I faced a tremendous amount of good and at times fun challenges. Not only was I responsible for the entire studio from a technical standpoint, but I was also tasked with supporting the production team's pipeline by writing automated Python scripts and managing the render farm. This was where I first started using Python, incorporating it into every aspect of my job and daily tasks. I loved working there, and the people and culture were amazing.


##### Latcha & Associates
Realizing that it was time to move on from With A Twist Studio, I reached out to some old acquaintances in search of a new opportunity. Latcha & Associates had recently won a large Audi contract and were in need of more developers, so I decided to explore the opportunity. I have now been with Latcha for over 10 years and have held various roles, starting as a web app developer and eventually becoming a lead developer and manager. Throughout my time at Latcha, I have worked on numerous interesting and challenging projects, including diving into email development to support the email teams by learning Salesforce Marketing Cloud. I ended up building various automations and internal tools using their SDK in both Node and Python, even extending their Node SDK to include promises.

Later, I managed my own email account for VW Credit alongside two other developers. When that contract was up, I was presented with the opportunity to form a research and development department at Latcha. As the lead developer, I have been working on numerous proof-of-concepts, including creating an object detection mobile app using Python, Tensorflow, and Xcode, as well as a TTS using voice AI technology. Another exciting project was building an entire marketing platform in the Cloud, which required a deep dive into learning AWS while also figuring out how to architect and build the platform. Additionally, I had to develop training materials for our Delhi office in India.

I have taken one of our proof-of-concepts into production with a Ford pilot project for the 2023 Expedition, using my standard tech stack of Django, MySQL, Docker, Copilot, and AWS (ECS, RDS, ELB, S3, and CloudFront) to build an API with a content ingestion and management system. The API feeds content to a native mobile app based on the user scanning their VIN. I accessed a few other APIs from Ford to pull data using that VIN and then formulated a content package to respond back to the mobile app, providing the customer's actual vehicle specifics (trim, color, options, etc.).

This year I've been quite busy pushing coding abilites further along with expanding my management skills. Some of the more recent projects I've been working on are: 

Building a boat configurator using Django for the API. The project has presented many challenges that I've enjoyed solving. One of these chanelenges was that the boat company did not provide clean or usable configuration data in order to build out each of their boats. Our CG department had been working closely with their engineering team to help extract the required data needed. However, I still had to figure out a path to taking that data and turning it into viable configurator data for the API. Also, the clients had brought to our attention that we had to use their instance of Azure which I had experienced yet, just AWS. It took me the course of about five days to dive in a prove out my stack in Azure DevOps and their portal. The project has taken a few turns and was on hold for quite a few months based on the parent clients direction.

Another really great opportunity has been working on a SaaS project for marketing to dealerships. I've always been a big fan of SaaS and I feel it's something our company should be doing more of. This has been my first direct ecommerce development project and after a few weeks of research I choose to use Stripe to handle the customers transactions and subscription management.


Managing and mentoring a team of four developers in Delhi, India for a dynamic SaaS marketing project in AWS, leveraging Node.js and SendGrid




##### Side Projects

###### Crypto Bots

I began my journey into the world of cryptocurrency in the fall of 2017, just before the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. What initially captivated me about this field was not just the potential to earn profits, but also the prospect of automating trades. As a result, I began researching successful traders, trading platforms, and various trading strategies.

Over the past five years, I have gained a wealth of knowledge in trading and bot creation. However, the most significant lesson that I have learned is the psychology of money and how to maintain objectivity in the face of market fluctuations.
