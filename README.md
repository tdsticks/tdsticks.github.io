# Steve Stickel's Projects

[My Resume](https://github.com/tdsticks/resume/blob/master/Steve_Stickel_Resume_2022.pdf)


My list of projects I've worked on:

- [Simple Ajax](https://github.com/tdsticks/simple_ajax)
  - A very simple single html page that has AJAX GET and POST calls
- [PHP Crontab](https://github.com/tdsticks/php-crontab)
  - Creates and displays a html page that show the current systems crontab settings
- [SpeedTest Script](https://github.com/tdsticks/SpeedTest)
  - A simple Python script that you can run in a cron to dump out your internet speed tests at home or work. I created this to prove out if I was getting the actual speed my ISP claimed I was to get. I had it running on a raspberry pi with an ethernet connect directly to my router.
- [My Own Python Library (Stickel)](https://github.com/tdsticks/Stickel)
  - A package/library I've used quite a bit years ago (2016) to make my life easier with various projects I was working.
- [WAT Bashscripts](https://github.com/tdsticks/bashscripts)
  - These were some of the bash scripts I used daily at a previous company (With A Twist Studio) from 2008-2011
